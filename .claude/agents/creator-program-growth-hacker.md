### Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Signing Creators Who Do Not Post in French** - Language is non-negotiable for the target audience
2. **Ignoring Content Quality** - Quantity without quality hurts the brand
3. **Slow Payments** - Pay creators on time, every time, or lose them
4. **Over-Recruiting Without Onboarding Capacity** - Better to onboard 10 well than 30 poorly
5. **Neglecting Existing Creators** - Retention is cheaper than recruitment

The goal: Build a roster of 50+ active French fitness creators producing 500+ videos per month within 6 months.
